  <h1>Project-GC Addon Progress</h1>
  <p>This page lets you select your <a href="https://www.geocaching.com/help/index.php?pg=kb.chapter&id=7&pgid=118" class="external_link">&quot;My Finds&quot;</a> GPX file and get a report of your progress towards the Project-GC BadgeGen <a href="https://project-gc.com/w/BadgeGen#Addons" class="external_link">addons</a>. This report is generated entirely in your browser; no part of your GPX file is sent over the internet. Please be patient if you have a large number of finds. Expand the list below to see some limitations of this tool.</p>
  
  <details>
    <summary>Limitations</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>Lab caches are completely absent from the &quot;My Finds&quot; GPX file. All addons for the <b>Lab Cacher</b> Badge are therefore excluded. This can also cause the value for the <b>Busy Cacher</b> Badge and <b>Diverse Cacher</b> Badge addon to be one type short.</li>
      <li>The addons for the <b>Achiever</b> Badge may be slightly incorrect as Project-GC maintains a <a href="https://project-gc.com/w/Challenge_cache#Challenge_Exceptions" class="external_link">list</a> of exceptions for classifying a cache as a challenge cache.</li>
      <li>The addons for the <b>All Around Cacher</b> Badge are excluded for three reasons:
        <ul>
          <li>If you take advantage of the <a href="https://www.geocaching.com/help/index.php?pg=kb.chapter&id=106&pgid=807" class="external_link">solved coordinate</a> feature, then the original coordinates will not be listed in the &quot;My Finds&quot; GPX file, and it is the original coordinates that are used by Project-GC for this computation.</li>
          <li>Your <a href="https://www.geocaching.com/account/settings/homelocation" class="external_link">home location</a> is not listed in your &quot;My Finds&quot; GPX file and would have to be entered separately.</li>
          <li>Project-GC itself recognizes that small differences in how the angle is computed could result in different outcomes in other tools for caches near the boundaries.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>You will only earn credit for a hosted event if you also logged that you attended.</li>
      <li>The addons for the <b>High Altitude Cacher</b> Badge and <b>Low Altitude Cacher</b> Badge are excluded as elevation information is not present in the &quot;My Finds&quot; GPX file.</li>
      <li>The addons for the <b>Long-Distance Cacher</b> Badge are excluded as the home coordinates are not present in the &quot;My Finds&quot; GPX file. Since there are either completed or not (i.e. you can&apos;t make partial progress on them), I don&apos;t deem it important enough to allow the home coordinates entered separately.</li>
      <li>The <b>All counties</b> addon is excluded from the Country Badges as this information is not included in the &quot;My Finds&quot; GPX file.</li>
      <li>I do not know if I correctly handled cases where there are more than one found log on a cache.</li>
      <li>Grid loops are not reported in the &quot;Way to 81&quot; table.</li>
    </ul>
