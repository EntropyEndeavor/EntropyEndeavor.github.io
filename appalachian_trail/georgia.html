  <h1>Appalachian Trail in Georgia</h1>
  <hr>
  <section id="at_day_1"><h2>24 March 2023 &mdash; Day 1</h2>
  <p>I was fortunate enough to have my parents be willing to bring me to Amicalola Falls from the St. Louis area, which saved me from having to worry about transportation to the trailhead. We turned it into a four day road trip which allowed time to for other adventures along the way including two new state high points, getting some old Geocaches around Lake Lanier, and seeing some family. It was a very hectic couple of months winding down at work and getting my apartment emptied out and cleaned, so I was still making last minute preparations, like finishing shopping for food, up until the day before.</p>
  
  <p>After getting dropped off at the temporary Visitor&apos;s Center (the permanent one was still under construction) I headed in to get a briefing on Leave No Trace principles. It also covered what to expect the first week, where to get supplies and so forth. The briefer seemed a tiny bit dubious any of us could even survive that first week, and when you then immediately see someone getting persuaded to not start out carrying two tents with them, that sort of makes sense. My biggest take away from the briefing was that the expected storms that night meant that the shelter I was planning to use at the top of Mount Springer might not be the best idea after all. I was given my hang tag as NOBO (north bound) hiker number 1614 and went on my way.</p>
  
  <p>Before even starting the AT, I first had to complete the 8.8 mile Approach Trail. This trail provides the opportunity to see the highest waterfall in Georgia, Amicalola Falls, while climbing some 600 steps. It makes for a great warm-up. At the base I ran into the first bit of trouble for the day trying to get an untested piece of gear to work. I wasn&apos;t getting any water out of my water house. The hose attached to bottles on the outside of my pack and I had gotten it last minute to replace my water bladder as literally every single piece of AT advice I found beforehand said not to use a bladder. In the process of figuring out there was toggle near the bite valve, the O-ring popped out and I wasted plenty of time before eventually getting it shoved back in place with a credit card.</p>
  
  <p>The stairs themselves were a little tiring, but not at all bad with plenty of scenic stops along the way. I was expecting far more and was surprised when I reached the top. From then on it was a lot of mild up and down terrain to Springer. Not too challenging, but I could definitely tell that I hadn&apos;t backpacked at all the year before. I did get sunburned due to forgetting to put on sunscreen in the excitement of the day and had very unexpected chaffing. I attribute that more to running around in the woods in jeans the day before when it was surprisingly hot as it wasn&apos;t a problem again until the summer heat in New Jersey.</p>
  
  <p>Finally reached Springer Mountain, and the official start of the AT, in the early afternoon. There was a larger group of college students doing a day hike, but no other thru-hikers as far as I could tell. I had only seen a couple other thru-hikers at the briefing and a couple more that I passed on the approach trail, but not the massive hoard I expected. Signed the summit register, took my picture, and continued on. Felt great at this point and I would have loved to have stuck to my original plan of camping at this shelter, but I did decide getting to lower ground for the storm seemed wise. Felt much more tired for the extra three miles to Stover Creek Shelter. There were no shortage of thru-hikers at the shelter though. The shelter itself was completely full, but despite plenty of tents set up around it as well, it was not a problem to find a tent site, and I intended to camp anyway (at least at this point). The storm did end up being really crazy with a tree falling somewhere in the vicinity of camp. An eventful start to a grand adventure.</p>

  <section id="at_day_2"><h2>25 March 2023 &mdash; Day 2</h2>
  <p>Not the most fun to pack up a wet tent after the very first night out, especially one I was not familiar with yet. After some experimentation, I could pack up my previous REI quarter dome tent soaking wet without getting my hands dirty at all. Not the case yet for the new Durston trekking pole tent which far exceeded the layout of my home made footprint.</p>
  <p>I knew that it didn&apos;t make sense to try to plan too far in advance for the trail, but I did make a plan for the first week or so in order to intentionally start slow (about eight miles a day) while maximizing the amount of shelters I could use. The extra three miles yesterday made for a tough decision today. I could get back on track for the original plan with a really short five mile day. If I wanted to go further, and also end at a shelter, it would be closer to thirteen, and I already hiked more miles than I wanted yesterday. I decided on the short day.</p>
  <p>This meant there was absolutely no time pressure at all. Took my time enjoying the blue blaze to Long Creek Falls. The AT uses white blazes (white rectangles of paint marking the trail) and all side trails use blue blazes of paint. There are a lot of features or views (or trail infrastructure) that is not directly on the trail, so when time and willingness permits there are often side trips available to interesting spots. The trail to Long Creek Falls was just 0.1 miles each way. Got to Hawk Mountain Shelter mid-day. Since I really didn&apos;t feel like this was enough hiking, I walked to the summit of Hawk Mountain as well after getting camp set up. This is not a &quot;highly interesting&quot; location that draws a lot of traffic, so the trail was not well marked or maintained near the road to the summit.</p>
  <p>Another really crowded night at the shelter. One other thing that made the short days at the start of the thru-hike (combined with a hiking style without many breaks) nice was getting premium camping spots early on when the trail is the most crowded. The rest of the day was spent socializing with other hikers. It takes an unusual sort of person to think it would be a good idea to go backpacking for six months, so there were a lot of interesting characters. This is even more exaggerated at the very start where you also have some more impulsive hikers who unfortunately don&apos;t always make it that far. There are a lot of people hoping to hike away trauma of some sort (military veterans are a common example). Also a lot of adventurous types with the scars and injuries to prove it.</p>

  <section id="at_day_3"><h2>26 March 2023 &mdash; Day 3</h2>
  <p>Back on schedule with an eight mile day. Eight miles is really not that different from what I had done on most other backpacking trips where the goal was to be on vacation relaxing. I&apos;m a big fan of getting to camp really early to have time to read or just do nothing and relax in nature. With so many miles to go, and a different mindset, it did feel weird to stop for the day at 12:30.</p>
  <p>Encountered my first trail magic. Trail magic is when someone sets up (almost always at a road crossing) and provides food for the hikers that come through. This was a simple one with just some chips and bottles of water, but a bottle of water was exactly what I needed at the moment. I had what I needed for my main water setup, but I had failed to start with a smaller bottle to mix electrolytes in.</p>
  <p>The day contained a number of reminders to remain vigilant against mishap. I sprained my ankle back in 2019 which makes it more prone to future injury, and indeed I had a close call with it today. I also almost left food wrappers in the hip pocket of my pack overnight. (If you aren&apos;t concerned enough about bears to worry about your food, I would suggest you should at least be concerned about the mice chewing up your tent!) This was also when I saw the first person quit their thru-hike attempt. They got bad heat exhaustion (it was indeed warm despite being March), handed out their extra food to everyone else at camp, and left the trail the next day.</p>

  <section id="at_day_4"><h2>27 March 2023 &mdash; Day 4</h2>
  <p>Woody Gap was something of a landmark as it was the first place along the trail with trash cans and the first toilet supplied with toilet paper (still just a pit toilet though). Crossed the 1% finished mark pretty much right at a spring where a number of hikers were refilling their water. No one else seemed to what to hear such an interesting statistic for some unknowable reason...</p>
  <p>I considered stopping for the day at the Lance Creek Camping area since that would be right at my eight mile per day goal. However the next section contained a bear canister restriction. Between March 1st and June 1st you aren&apos;t allowed to camp along that section of trail without a bear canister due to past problems. Once I entered it I would have to get to the end, and it contained the much hyped Blood Mountain. So therefore I got as close to the start of the camping ban as I could.</p>
  <p>I was the first to arrive at the edge of the camping restriction (among the people who would stay the night there that is). There is apparently some camping right where the trail meets Jarrard Gap (and from the sound of it another group did end up using it) but I wasn&apos;t impressed with the options. There was another campsite that was marked on the maps by turning left down the road and then immediately left again on another trail. It barely shows up on FarOut, but showed up better on the maps I use for Geocaching. Ended up being a much smaller spot than I was expecting, but worked nicely. Since it was a bit more obscure no one else showed up, and it was really weird to camp alone after three nights at very crowded shelters. That would be really lonely if it was all the time, but it was really nice as an occasional occurrence. Definitely missed having privies and bear boxes though.</p>

  <section id="at_day_5"><h2>28 March 2023&mdash; Day 5</h2>
  <p>Climbing up Blood Mountain really was not that bad. The shelter at the top was an interesting stone hut instead of the typical wood structure. Climbing down was a bit more treacherous, mostly due to other hikers. The normal dirt path gave way to some bare rock slopes. I didn&apos;t find them too challenging, but I witnessed at least one instance of a person slipping, falling down, and taking out the person in front of them as well. Hard to avoid having people nearby behind you as the AT is basically a parade of hikers this early in the season.</p>
  <p>At Neel Gap was the first AT focused outfitter Mountain Crossing. The trail actually goes through the building itself, which is unique. I only needed to pick up a few supplemental food options at this point. One of the things I had forgot to get before starting was a small bottle of hand sanitizer. I was having a lot of trouble finding one in the store, and once I thought I finally did find it I failed to pay close enough attention. Ended up purchasing a useless hand-sanitizer-shaped bottle of hair gel that I then had to lug around until I could properly dispose of it.</p>
  <p>Felt more tired at the end of the day on the last few climbs to Baggs Creek Camp, another informal campsite. Decent number of people ended up staying there. We all got our first real experience seeing what was possible with &quot;trail legs&quot; when a hiker that had just finished the Benton MacKaye Trail (and was doing a bit of the Appalachian Trail just to fill extra time) rolled into camp after some insane miles and then proceeded to just set up a tarp shelter and eating raw protein powder. Coldest night so far camping up on the ridge.</p>

  <section id="at_day_6"><h2>29 March 2023 &mdash; Day 6</h2>
  <p>It continued to be brutally cold through the morning. Every other day so far I had been hiking in a t-shirt and shorts from the start, but today I had to wear all my layers, slowly getting rid of them as the day warmed up. I doubt I would have been motivated to get out into the cold so quickly if it weren&apos;t for a hiker whose Ursack had been taken from the site. This was concerning since I had one as well. It ended up being a mistake, two had been secured close together and the other owner had grabbed the wrong one and left without eating breakfast first (which would have revealed the mix-up). Mine was further from camp and right where I left it. The other Ursacks got swapped back later in the day further up the trail.</p>
  <p>Immediately met with a hard climb up to Cowrock Mountain, but found the rest of the day to be a relatively easy hike to Low Gap Shelter. Made plans for my first real resupply and hostel stay, more plans that didn&apos;t survive implementation unmodified.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="at_day_7"><h2>30 March 2023 &mdash; Day 7</h2>
  <p>Found the terrain to Blue Mountain Shelter really easy. Despite getting there really early in the day I was planning to stay there, and take a rest day just to Unicoi Gap to get a long shuttle to the hostel. It really did feel like time to start increasing the mileage a tiny bit though. I had already booked the hostel room for the next day, but after fretting over the maps it really didn&apos;t seem too bad to go further today and make it all the way Dick&apos;s Creek Gap tomorrow (which would be right next to the hostel) and push the rest day to the day after.</p>
  <p>The terrain was much trickier with climbs and descents past the shelter. Spent the night at the Cheese Factory Site (with a disappointing lack of cheese or factories) where someone else with a trekking pole tent had managed to lose their trekking poles already and was looking for a suitable stick!</p>

  <section id="at_day_8"><h2>31 March 2023 &mdash; Day 8</h2>
  <p>The terrain and distance was an aggressive combination compared to what I had hiked so far, but still finished mid afternoon. Had to call ahead from Powell Mountain for a shuttle to the hostel. After that it felt like a huge race down the mountain to make it by the estimated time. This is all sort of comical in hindsight as the hostel was easily within walking distance of the trail, it ended up that it would have been a trivial hitch, and I got to the bottom <b>well</b> before my estimated time anyway. Good number of other hikers waiting at the road crossing as well, so the wait went quickly. Got to chat with a previous SOBO (south bound) thru-hiking ridge-runner about what still lay ahead.</p>
  <p>Hostel Around the Bend provided a shuttle into town on a schedule as well. Two hours to both resupply at the store and get dinner at the all-you-can-eat buffet was a bit daunting. Every single grocery store along the trail has a completely different layout for where things are located, so it is never as quick as you would hope to resupply. The selection is never exactly the same either, there is also something you have to substitute. This had the extra difficulty of being the first resupply and I didn&apos;t have the food dialed in at this point, but at least it was a full grocery store. The buffet was a great opportunity to sample some things I wouldn&apos;t spend the money to have tried such as catfish and hushpuppies.</p>
  <p>The most useful intel from the hostel was about a problem bear at Carter Gap Shelter. Altogether the bear got food from easily over a hundred hikers during the season, defeating PCT hangs, Ursacks and even a bear canister. I decided that there wasn&apos;t enough security to justify the extra weight of the Ursack compared to using a PCT hang, so I swapped it out here. I would consider my backpacking gear to be sort of mid-tear. Definitely backpacking specific, but not expensive ultralight gear. The stuff I got at the hostel for a bear hang actually was the brand name ultralight gear, and it turned out it mostly wasn&apos;t up to the rigors of the trail. In the future I&apos;ll personally always be prioritizing durability over gear being lightweight.</p>
  <p>Had a terrible night of sleep until I discovered the magic of earplugs. I had never needed earplugs before while staying in hostels in Europe, and putting them in for the first time ever seemed a little unsettling for some reason. Worked wonders this night and many other nights along the trail though.</p>

  <section id="at_day_9"><h2>1 April 2023 &mdash; Day 9</h2>
  <p>When I first booked the hostel, yesterday was supposed to be the easy day with only a little bit of walking to make it to the trailhead. Going further to the other trailhead meant that yesterday was a full day of hiking, and today would have to be the easy day instead. Hung around the hostel until early afternoon before heading out. This was a convenient time to take care of laundry and other tasks to avoid having to schedule around the other guests all trying to accomplish the same last night.</p>
  <p>I had originally considered just going 0.5 miles up the trail to a tentsite, but the weather was nicer than expected and after awhile it just didn&apos;t seem to make sense to continue sitting around. The 4.5 miles to Plum Orchard Gap Shelter seemed to take longer than it actually did. Overall I found throughout the trail that short days with the hiking at the end were always less restful than having the hiking at the start. That way you are done when you are done, instead of having to always be making a decision about when to get started with the hiking.</p>

  <section id="at_day_10"><h2>2 April 2023 &mdash; Day 10</h2>
  <p>The main highlight of the day was crossing the border into North Carolina after finishing the first state of the AT. The trail was easy to this point. The border had collected a small (ever shifting) group of hikers who were celebrating the accomplishment. Directly off to the left was a steep, eroded dirt hill where everyone was hanging out to not be directly blocking the trail. Many pictures were taken.</p>
