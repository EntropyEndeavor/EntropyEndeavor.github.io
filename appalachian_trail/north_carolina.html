  <section id="at_day_10"><h2>2 April 2023 &mdash; Day 10</h2>
  <p>There was little time to celebrate being in North Carolina before immediately (and I do mean immediately) being hit with a couple hard, steep climbs in a row to Sharp Top and Courthouse Bald. Neither were long and they were both over quickly, but they were a huge step up in difficulty from anything in Georgia. Also now there were also some mosquitoes to deal with.</p>
  <p>Thankfully the trail flattened out after the initial climbs and the rest of the day was uneventful to Standing Indian Shelter. There were a number of campsites all around the general vicinity of the shelter while still being far enough apart to feel like separate sites, so there wasn&apos;t as much mingling. This was the first time cooking one of the Knorr packets while backpacking and I was not diligent enough to prevent the food sticking to the bottom of my pan (the flat noodles are the worst for sticking anyway, even when careful). It took a very long time to dislodge it all with the tools I had available at this point in the hike.</p>

  <section id="at_day_11"><h2>3 April 2023 &mdash; Day 11</h2>
  <p>This was the first day I really pushed to have &quot;bigger&quot; miles. This was due to two main considerations. The first was a desire to skip over Carter Gap Shelter and the surrounding area due to reports of bear problems. The second was to be as close to the pick up point for the Franklin shuttle as possible so I could get the early shuttle and therefore have time in town before catching the later shuttle back to trail. I always prefer staying at shelters anyway, and the 16.7 mile day to Long Branch Shelter perfectly aligned with both goals.</p>
  <p>It was a hard day to have picked for an increase in miles. There was a good sized climb to Standing Indian Mountain first thing in the day, but it would have been an easy hike to Carter Gap Shelter from there if it wasn&apos;t for the first daytime rain storm. Just barely didn&apos;t make it to that first shelter for lunch before the rain started, so I arrived cold and wet. Rain got even harder while I was there, but another hiker was still able to somehow get a fire going in the pit outside. No bear problems just staying there for lunch, and by the time I left it was just a drizzle for the rest of the day.</p>
  
  <p>The climb to Albert Mountain was the first truly challenging (but also really fun) mountain of the trail with rocky and steep terrain. It would have been even more enjoyable if not slippery! Since it was windy and there wasn&apos;t much visibility anyway, there didn&apos;t seem to be much reason to climb the fire tower today. Right after starting the descent I passed the 100 mile mark on the AT which was indicated by stones laid out to spell &quot;100&quot;. This was how most milestones ended up being  From here it was all downhill to get to Long Branch Shelter. Spent my first night in the shelter itself in hopes of getting an even earlier start the next morning.</p>

  <section id="at_day_12"><h2>4 April 2023 &mdash; Day 12</h2>
  <p>I got out of camp maybe slightly earlier than I would have camping, but not all that dramatic of a difference. Still made it to the Rock Gap Parking with plenty of time left before the first shuttle of the day. Only a couple people went in to town on the shuttle with me. I had plenty of food left at this point, the only reason I felt that I needed to get to Franklin was to grab a new fuel canister. I&apos;m pretty sure I didn&apos;t end up touching the fuel can I bought until the next resupply point anyway (therefore meaning I didn&apos;t actually <i>need</i> to go to Franklin after all). This perhaps lead me to be a little too careless with the fuel later on...</p>
  <p>I hadn&apos;t realized that Franklin was a town I had already spent a good amount of time exploring on a previous trip to hike to six state high points. I had investigated all the Geocaches along the trail before the hike, but not in the trail towns as I didn&apos;t know which ones I&apos;d actually be visiting. Discovering that I had already found the Geocaches in town left less to do than expected! Picked up the fuel can at Outdoor 76 which was also handing out free buffs to the thru-hikers. I just shoved it somewhere in my pack not thinking much of it, but it did become an important item later in the hike. Spent the rest of the time before the mid-day shuttle back to Rock Gap grabbing some town food and hunting for postcards. This time the shuttle was completely packed and extra full with all the backpacks.</p>
  <p>Had plenty of time after getting back on trail to make it to Siler Bald Shelter for the night. Went in from the first of the blue blazed trails and it was about half a mile to make it to the shelter. Despite this the shelter was still pretty crowded. It also was one of the worst nights for bugs in the southern part of the trail. Ended up wearing the extra layers not because it was cold, just to keep the bugs off. Recruited a friend to split a room at the Nantahala Outdoor Center (NOC) in a couple days.</p>

  <p>I was able to stop a hot spot on my heel from developing into a blister with some Leukotape I had been given at the shelter the night before. Took the same long path back out from the shelter to the trail. After a bit the trail paralleled a road up to the top of Wayah Bald which contained an interesting large fire tower. A nearby parking lot provided us with a trash can and the day hikers with easy access. The overlook contained signs describing different forest management techniques and pinpointing where to spot areas they had been applied when looking out over the mountains. Some of the areas looked absolutely terrible and deforested, especially the areas that were closer to the Bald and thus not immediately in view from the tower.</p>
  <p>After that it was just a very normal sort of day on the AT. Lots of ups and downs, but none that were major. Ended the day at Cold Spring Shelter. It was an unusually small shelter basically right on the trail with absolutely no flat surface for tenting immediately visible. The tenting area ended up being a long but narrow strip of land up a short hill a little further down the trail. By the time everyone had set up for the night the tents were basically touching. Spent the evening playing cards on the much smaller than usual picnic table up in the camping area.</p>

  <section id="at_day_14"><h2>6 April 2023 &mdash; Day 14</h2>
  <p>Today was just about getting to the NOC to make the room reservation. Took a short side trip up Rocky Bald along the way. At Wesser Bald Fire Tower I was able to recruit a third hiker to split our room. The descent into the NOC was incredibly long. It was not technically hard in absolute terms, but more rocky and steep than had been encountered to this point. It was also somewhat &quot;exposed&quot;. There were large drop offs to the side, and less tree cover meant that the views were out into space, adding to the sense that this was a location where it would be possible to get seriously injured if you fell. I was very glad the rain hadn&apos;t come and made the rocks slippery.</p>
  <p>The room itself was pretty spartan, being little more than some bunk beds. The showers were in a shared restroom behind curtains. Normally with such a setup I would expect two curtains with a little changing area to store clothes in between. No such luck here, one curtain opening directly to the restroom is all you get, with the benches being across the room. There were no laundry facilities available, so clothes got washed in the sink. After dropping off packs in the room and getting somewhat presentable it was time to explore the rest of the site. I got my Smokies permit printed at the outfitter and then headed over to the general store for a resupply. This was a very challenging resupply for me as the selection was very limited. The hardest part for me was having to go without bagels for breakfast, but I&apos;m a picky eater in general and I had to make due with basically none of the food I would have bought for hiking at a grocery store. Luckily it was only a couple of days to the next resupply and I was able to find stuff I could work with. The restaurant food was delicious.</p>

  <section id="at_day_15"><h2>7 April 2023 &mdash; Day 15</h2>
  <p>I wasn&apos;t completely sure what I was going to do for today, but I decided on taking a much needed full rest (or &quot;zero&quot;) day. It was the first one of the trail after two weeks now, which was twice as many days as my longest backpacking trip before this. It would also allow me to skip the first of two days of rain in the forecast. I switched over to the larger bunk room at the NOC as my roommates for the previous night decided to carry on instead.</p>
  <p>I spent the bulk on the day just hanging out in the lounge. I finally was able to wrangle enough hikers together to play some Euchre. Other than that, I spent a frustrating amount of time trying to deal with unnecessarily complicated health insurance related issues as my residue insurance from my last job was finally coming to an end. For dinner I was able to cook up some proper noodles that had been left in the hiker box in a real kitchen!</p>
  
  <p>This was the first place I noticed a big shake up in the other hikers around me. Many went on ahead while I took my zero. Many more stayed the next day as well to avoid as much rain as possible. Some of them I saw again later on, but there were some people I never saw or heard from again after having seen them pretty regularly up to this point.</p>

  <section id="at_day_16"><h2>8 April 2023 &mdash; Day 16</h2>
  <p>This was just a completely miserable day. This was the second of two days of forecasted rain, but yesterday the rain was just an on and off drizzle (at least at the NOC, which doesn&apos;t guarantee that was what the weather was like on the trail). I was expecting the same as I set out for the day. The climb out of the NOC is known for being really long, with eight straight miles of ascent. It was always in my mind that I might end for the day just at the first shelter only seven miles in. It was raining hard at the start of the day, and it just kept on raining hard. My spirits were actually pretty high at first. I figured that we really hadn&apos;t had a good bit of adversity to suffer through yet to make it a good adventure. I was reading <i>The Hidden Life of Trees</i> by Peter Wohlleben at the shelters, and had been keeping my eye out for the phenomena it described. It was really cool to find perfect examples today of a section I had just read where trees on a slope are curved at the base from snow bending weak young trees before straightening further up from when the tree is stronger. My good mood lasted until about noon when I started to get really cold, and it took another hour or so to make it to Sassafras Gap Shelter. Every time I seemed to check the map I would only be 0.1 miles, if that, further along.</p>
  <p>I was freezing and there was absolutely no way I was continuing on past the shelter. There were a couple people in the top of the shelter who I don&apos;t think had hiked at all today, and I believe I was the first to arrive for the day. As fast as I could I emptied my backpack to get out my sleeping bag, tore off my wet clothes, got inside, and didn&apos;t get out again until dinner time. Throughout the day hikers continued to arrive in worse shape. A lot of people couldn&apos;t use their hands well enough to open the buckles on their packs. Slowly the shelter filled up to capacity and then beyond. The last pair of hikers to arrive wasn&apos;t able to get a spot in the shelter at all. I gave my emergency foil blanket to a hiker whose thing summer weight sleeping bag had gotten soaked.</p>
  <p>I had had extraordinarily good weather before this, and it was a good reminder of how serious bad weather can make a situation.</p>

  <section id="at_day_17"><h2>9 April 2023 &mdash; Day 17</h2>
  <p>Thankfully this was a nice warm sunny day to follow the cold rain of yesterday. My shoes were still completely soaked in the morning. Although I had a dry pair of socks to use, just tying the shoe laces squeezes the water from the shoe into the socks before I even took a step. One of the big advantages of trail runners over boots was that my shoes were completely dry by mid-day, and taking them off for a bit let the socks completely dry back out as well.</p>
  <p>There was elaborate Easter trail magic at Stecoah Gap. It had been set up for a couple days already, which meant that perusing the list of those who stopped by provided some reassurance that the hikers who had headed out to face both days of rain had managed alright. Next up was the infamously hard Jacobs Ladder which is a steep climb. The climb was tough, but it was over before I knew it and upon arrival at Brown Fork Gap Shelter there really didn&apos;t seem to be any reason not to hike the extra six miles to the next shelter. This was really the start of where I would consistently pick the further of two options to the day, but still not quite what I would describe as having &quot;trail legs&quot;. I ended the day at Cable Gap Shelter.</p>

  <section id="at_day_18"><h2>10 April 2023 &mdash; Day 18</h2>
  <p>I had gone further than I needed to yesterday, which meant today was going to be a shorter day of hiking as I absolutely had to stay at the fancy Fontana Dam Shelter. It was a cold start to hiking. Every time it looked like the trail was just about to get direct sunlight the path would turn away and it would remain obscured behind the hills. The day's hiking was over in no time and I found myself at the Fontana Marina.</p>
  <p>Other hikers were passing through and we took turns watching the bags while resupplying from the bait shop. It was another tricky resupply with limited options, but this time it would have to get me through the Smokies. I did the best that I could, but I couldn&apos;t bring myself to settle on the breakfast options there, and would instead have to try at the gas station at the resort. I did enjoy my free freeze pop that came with the groceries though!</p>
  <p>I ran into a hiker in the parking lot who had hurt their ankle and was staying involved in the trail community by helping out and giving rides into town, which meant I was able to get directly to the resort without waiting for a shuttle to arrive. </p>
