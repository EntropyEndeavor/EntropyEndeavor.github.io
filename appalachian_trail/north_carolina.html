  <p>There was little time to celebrate being in North Carolina before immediately (and I do mean immediately) being hit with a couple hard, steep climbs in a row to Sharp Top and Courthouse Bald. Neither were long and they were both over quickly, but they were a huge step up in difficulty from anything in Georgia. Also now there were also some mosquitoes to deal with.</p>
  <p>Thankfully the trail flattened out after the initial climbs and the rest of the day was uneventful to Standing Indian Shelter. There were a number of campsites all around the general vicinity of the shelter while still being far enough apart to feel like separate sites, so there wasn&apos;t as much mingling. This was the first time cooking one of the Knorr packets while backpacking and I was not diligent enough to prevent the food sticking to the bottom of my pan (the flat noodles are the worst for sticking anyway, even when careful). It took a very long time to dislodge it all with the tools I had available at this point in the hike.</p>

  <section id="at_day_11"><h2>3 April 2023 &mdash; Day 11</h2>
  <p>This was the first day I really pushed to have &quot;bigger&quot; miles. This was due to two main considerations. The first was a desire to skip over Carter Gap Shelter and the surrounding area due to reports of bear problems. The second was to be as close to the pick up point for the Franklin shuttle as possible so I could get the early shuttle and therefore have time in town before catching the later shuttle back to trail. I always prefer staying at shelters anyway, and the 16.7 mile day to Long Branch Shelter perfectly aligned with both goals.</p>
  <p>It was a hard day to have picked for an increase in miles. There was a good sized climb to Standing Indian Mountain first thing in the day, but it would have been an easy hike to Carter Gap Shelter from there if it wasn&apos;t for the first daytime rain storm. Just barely didn&apos;t make it to that first shelter for lunch before the rain started, so I arrived cold and wet. Rain got even harder while I was there, but another hiker was still able to somehow get a fire going in the pit outside. No bear problems just staying there for lunch, and by the time I left it was just a drizzle for the rest of the day.</p>
  
  <p>The climb to Albert Mountain was the first truly challenging (but also really fun) mountain of the trail with rocky and steep terrain. It would have been even more enjoyable if not slippery! Since it was windy and there wasn&apos;t much visibility anyway, there didn&apos;t seem to be much reason to climb the fire tower today. Right after starting the descent I passed the 100 mile mark on the AT which was indicated by stones laid out to spell &quot;100&quot;. This was how most milestones ended up being  From here it was all downhill to get to Long Branch Shelter. Spent my first night in the shelter itself in hopes of getting an even earlier start the next morning.</p>
