  <section id="at_day_10"><h2>2 April 2023 &mdash; Day 10</h2>
  <p>There was little time to celebrate being in North Carolina before immediately (and I do mean immediately) being hit with a couple hard, steep climbs in a row to Sharp Top and Courthouse Bald. Neither were long and they were both over quickly, but they were a huge step up in difficulty from anything in Georgia. Also now there were also some mosquitoes to deal with.</p>
  <p>Thankfully the trail flattened out after the initial climbs and the rest of the day was uneventful to Standing Indian Shelter. There were a number of campsites all around the general vicinity of the shelter while still being far enough apart to feel like separate sites, so there wasn&apos;t as much mingling. This was my first time cooking one of the Knorr packets while backpacking and I was not diligent enough to prevent the food sticking to the bottom of my pan (the flat noodles were the worst for sticking anyway, even when careful). It took a very long time to dislodge it all with the tools I had available at this point in the hike.</p>

  <section id="at_day_11"><h2>3 April 2023 &mdash; Day 11</h2>
  <p>This was the first day I really pushed to have &quot;bigger&quot; miles. This was due to two main considerations. The first was a desire to skip over Carter Gap Shelter and the surrounding area due to reports of bear problems. The second was to be as close to the pick up point for the Franklin shuttle as possible so I could get the earliest one, and therefore have time in town before catching the later shuttle back to trail. I always prefer staying near shelters anyway, and the 16.7 mile day to Long Branch Shelter perfectly aligned with both goals.</p>
  <p>It was a hard day to have picked for an increase in miles. There was a good sized climb to Standing Indian Mountain first thing in the day, but it would have been an easy hike to Carter Gap Shelter from there if it wasn&apos;t for the first daytime rain storm. Just barely didn&apos;t make it to that first shelter for lunch before the rain started, so I arrived cold and wet. The rain got even harder while I was there, but another hiker was still able to somehow get a roaring fire going in the pit outside. No bear problems just staying there for lunch, and by the time I left it was just a drizzle for the rest of the day.</p>
  
  <p>The climb to Albert Mountain was the first truly challenging (but also really fun) mountain of the trail with rocky and steep terrain. It would have been even more enjoyable if not slippery! Since it was windy and there wasn&apos;t much visibility anyway, there didn&apos;t seem to be much reason to climb the fire tower today. Right after starting the descent I passed the 100 mile mark on the AT which was indicated by stones laid out to spell &quot;100&quot;. This was how most milestones ended up being indicated. From here it was all downhill to get to Long Branch Shelter. Spent my first night in the shelter itself in hopes of getting an even earlier start the next morning.</p>

  <section id="at_day_12"><h2>4 April 2023 &mdash; Day 12</h2>
  <p>I got out of camp maybe slightly earlier than I would have camping, but not all that dramatic of a difference. Still made it to the Rock Gap Parking with plenty of time left before the first shuttle of the day. Only a couple people went in to town on the shuttle with me. I had plenty of food left at this point, the only reason I felt that I needed to get to Franklin was to grab a new fuel canister. I&apos;m pretty sure I didn&apos;t end up touching the fuel can I bought until the next resupply point anyway (therefore meaning I didn&apos;t actually <i>need</i> to go to Franklin after all). This perhaps lead me to be a little too careless with the fuel later on...</p>
  <p>I hadn&apos;t realized that Franklin was a town I had already spent a good amount of time exploring on a previous trip where my goal was to hike to six state high points. I had investigated all the Geocaches along the trail before the hike, but not in the trail towns as I didn&apos;t know which ones I&apos;d actually be visiting. Discovering that I had already found the Geocaches in town left less to do than expected! Picked up the fuel can at Outdoor 76 which was also handing out free buffs to the thru-hikers. I just shoved it somewhere in my pack not thinking much of it, but it did become an important item later in the hike. Spent the rest of the time before the mid-day shuttle back to Rock Gap grabbing some town food and hunting for postcards. This time the shuttle was completely packed and extra full with all the large backpacks everyone had.</p>
  <p>Had plenty of time after getting back on trail to make it to Siler Bald Shelter for the night. Went in from the first of the blue blazed trails and it was about half a mile to make it to the shelter, which is abnormally far. Despite this the shelter was still pretty crowded. It also was one of the worst nights for bugs in the southern part of the trail. Ended up wearing my extra layers not because it was cold, just to keep the bugs off. Recruited a friend to split a room at the Nantahala Outdoor Center (NOC) in a couple days.</p>

  <p>I was able to stop a hot spot on my heel from developing into a blister with some Leukotape I had been given at the shelter the night before. Took the same long path back out from the shelter to the trail. After a bit, the trail paralleled a road up to the top of Wayah Bald which contained an interesting large fire tower. A nearby parking lot provided us with a trash can and the day hikers with easy access. The overlook contained signs describing different forest management techniques and pinpointing where to spot areas they had been applied when looking out over the mountains. Some of the areas looked absolutely terrible and deforested, especially the areas that were closer to the Bald and thus not immediately in view from the tower where it was difficult to see directly downwards.</p>
  <p>After that it was just a very normal sort of day on the AT. Lots of ups and downs, but none that were major. I ended the day at Cold Spring Shelter. It was an unusually small shelter basically right on the trail with absolutely no flat surface for tenting immediately visible. The tenting area ended up being a long but narrow strip of land up a short hill a little further down the trail. By the time everyone had set up for the night the tents were basically touching/overlapping. Spent the evening playing cards on the wobbly and much smaller than usual picnic table up in the camping area.</p>

  <section id="at_day_14"><h2>6 April 2023 &mdash; Day 14</h2>
  <p>Today was just about making it to the NOC in time for the room reservation. Took the short side trip up Rocky Bald along the way. At Wesser Bald Fire Tower I was able to recruit a third hiker to split our room, but I was never able to recruit someone for the fourth bed. The descent into the NOC was incredibly long. It was not technically hard in absolute terms, but more rocky and steep than had been encountered to this point. It was also somewhat &quot;exposed&quot;. There were large drop offs to the side, and less tree cover meant that the views were out into space, adding to the sense that this was a location where it would be possible to get seriously injured if you fell. I was very glad the rain hadn&apos;t come and made the rocks slippery.</p>
  <p>The room itself was pretty spartan, being little more than some bunk beds. The showers were in a shared restroom behind curtains. Normally with such a setup I would expect two curtains with a little changing area to store clothes in between. No such luck here, one curtain opening directly to the restroom is all you get, with the benches being all the way across the room. There were no laundry facilities available, so clothes got washed in the sink. After dropping off packs in the room and getting somewhat presentable, it was time to explore the rest of the site. I got my Smokies permit printed at the outfitter and then headed over to the general store for a resupply. This was a very challenging resupply for me as the selection was very limited. The hardest part for me was having to go without bagels for breakfast, but I&apos;m a picky eater in general and I had to make due with basically none of the food I would have bought for hiking at a grocery store. Luckily it was only a couple of days to the next resupply and I was able to find stuff I could work with. The restaurant food was delicious.</p>

  <section id="at_day_15"><h2>7 April 2023 &mdash; Day 15</h2>
  <p>I wasn&apos;t completely sure what I was going to do for today, but I decided on taking a much needed full rest (or &quot;zero&quot;, as in zero miles) day. It was the first one of the trail after two weeks now, which was twice as many days as my longest backpacking trip had been before this. It would also allow me to skip the first of two days of rain in the forecast. I switched over to the larger bunk room at the NOC as my roommates for the previous night decided to carry on instead.</p>
  <p>I spent the bulk on the day just hanging out in the lounge. I finally was able to wrangle enough hikers together to play some Euchre. Other than that, I spent a frustrating amount of time trying to deal with unnecessarily complicated health insurance related issues as my residual insurance from my last job was finally coming to an end. For dinner I was able to cook up some proper noodles that had been left in the hiker box in a real kitchen!</p>
  
  <p>This was the first place I noticed a big shake up in the other hikers around me. Many went on ahead while I took my zero. Many more stayed the next day as well to avoid as much rain as possible. Some of them I saw again later on, but there were some people I never saw or heard from again after having seen them pretty regularly up to this point.</p>

  <section id="at_day_16"><h2>8 April 2023 &mdash; Day 16</h2>
  <p>This was just a completely miserable day. This was the second of two days of forecasted rain, but yesterday the rain was just an on and off drizzle (at least at the NOC, which doesn&apos;t guarantee that was what the weather was like on the trail in the mountains). I was expecting the same as I set out for the day. The climb out of the NOC is known for being really long, with eight straight miles of ascent. It was always in my mind that I might end for the day at the first shelter only seven miles in. It was raining hard at the start of the day, and it just kept on raining hard. My spirits were actually pretty high at first. I figured that we really hadn&apos;t had a good bit of adversity to suffer through yet to make it a proper adventure. I was reading <i>The Hidden Life of Trees</i> by Peter Wohlleben at the shelters, and had been keeping my eye out for the phenomena it described. It was really cool to find perfect examples today of a section I had just read where trees on a slope are curved at the base from snow bending the weak young trees before straightening when the growing tree is finally stronger. My good mood lasted until about noon when I started to get really cold, and it took another hour or so to make it to Sassafras Gap Shelter. Every time I seemed to check the map I would only be 0.1 miles, if that, further along.</p>
  <p>I was freezing and there was absolutely no way I was continuing on past the shelter. There were a couple people in the top of the shelter who I don&apos;t think had hiked at all today, and I believe I was the first to arrive for the day. As fast as I could, I emptied my backpack to get out my sleeping bag, tore off my wet clothes, got inside, and didn&apos;t get out again until dinner time. Throughout the day hikers continued to arrive in worse and worse shape. A lot of people couldn&apos;t use their hands well enough to even open the buckles on their packs. Slowly the shelter filled up to capacity and then beyond. The last pair of hikers to arrive wasn&apos;t able to get a spot in the shelter at all. I gave my emergency foil blanket to a hiker whose thin summer weight sleeping bag had gotten soaked.</p>
  <p>I had had extraordinarily good weather (by AT standards) before this, and it was a good reminder of how serious bad weather can make a situation.</p>

  <section id="at_day_17"><h2>9 April 2023 &mdash; Day 17</h2>
  <p>Thankfully this was a nice warm sunny day to follow the cold rain of yesterday. My shoes were still completely soaked in the morning. Although I had a dry pair of socks to use, just tying the shoe laces tight squeezed the water from the shoe into the socks before I even took a step. One of the big advantages of trail runners over boots was that my shoes were completely dry by mid-day, and taking them off for a bit let the socks completely dry out as well.</p>
  <p>There was elaborate Easter trail magic at Stecoah Gap. It had been set up for a couple days already, which meant that perusing the list of those who stopped by provided some reassurance that the hikers who had headed out to face both days of rain had managed alright. Next up was the infamously hard Jacobs Ladder which is a steep climb. The climb was tough, but it was over before I knew it and upon arrival at Brown Fork Gap Shelter there really didn&apos;t seem to be any reason not to hike the extra six miles to the next shelter. This was really the start of where I would consistently pick the further of two options for shelters, but still not quite what I would describe as having &quot;trail legs&quot;. I ended the day at Cable Gap Shelter.</p>

  <section id="at_day_18"><h2>10 April 2023 &mdash; Day 18</h2>
  <p>I had gone further than I needed to yesterday, which meant today was going to be a shorter day of hiking as I absolutely had to stay at the fancy Fontana Dam Shelter. It was a cold start in the morning. Every time it looked like the trail was just about to get direct sunlight, the path would turn away and the sun would remain obscured behind the hills. The day&apos;s hiking was over in no time and I found myself at the Fontana Marina.</p>
  <p>Other hikers were passing through and we took turns watching the packs while resupplying from the bait shop. It was another tricky resupply with limited options, but this time it would have to get me through the Smokies. I did the best that I could, but I couldn&apos;t bring myself to settle on the breakfast options there, and would instead have to try at the gas station at the resort. I did enjoy my free freeze pop that came with the groceries though!</p>
  <p>I ran into a hiker in the parking lot who had hurt their ankle and was staying involved in the trail community by helping out and giving rides into town, which meant I was able to get directly to the resort without waiting for a shuttle to arrive. I went to the gas station for a supplemental resupply, but they didn&apos;t have bagels either, so I had to settle for Pop-Tarts for breakfasts again. I did pick up some additional snack items as well. After this I found a secluded corner of the balcony to sit, charge electronics, and have Wi-Fi access. This was the first time on the trail I had both complete downtime and wasn&apos;t on reliant cell signal, and it was nice to be able to catch up on the events of the world. There is something to be said for those who seek full immersion in the trail experience, but I personally love to keep track of what is going on!</p>
  <p>I waited as long as I could at the resort, but had to take an early dinner at their restaurant to be able to finish eating with enough time to catch their last shuttle back to the trail. There was a little bit of trail left to get to the Fontana Dam Shelter which was pretty flat and straightforward. Despite this, I almost wiped out tripping over absolutely nothing. Closest I had come so far, but still no falls! The shelter itself was massive! The tent spots were just concrete pads that used to contain picnic tables, so I opted for the shelter instead. The bathroom has indoor plumbing and a hot shower! The free buff served its first function as a makeshift towel. There was a chill party atmosphere around the campfire with singing and guitar.</p>

  <section id="at_day_19"><h2>11 April 2023 &mdash; Day 19</h2>
  <p>I faced a huge hassle when I went to retrieve my food bags in the morning. My food was hung using the PCT style which meant the line was wrapped around a stick using a clove hitch and the stick then acted as a toggle that stopped the line when it reached a carabiner that is attached to the food bags. When I pulled the line (that I had just bought back in Georgia) to lower it so I could remove the toggle nothing happened at first, and then the line snapped at the clove hitch. This left my food bags hanging in mid-air with nothing attached that was reachable from the ground. This wasn&apos;t an emergency survival situation as I was still near the resort, but I certainly didn&apos;t want to spend the effort or money to replace the full resupply I just bought (or leave the food behind as litter). The trees couldn&apos;t be climbed to get high enough with anything remotely resembling a tolerable level of risk. I borrowed a knife, wrapped it in the rock bag from my line to prevent stickiness, taped it to a big stick and tried to cut the line down. A couple hikers took turns and we eventually got it down. My guess is that the knife didn&apos;t actually cut the line, just that hitting it enough wiggled the line out of the clove hitch. Luckily I knew for certain that every shelter in the Smokies had bear cables, so I wouldn&apos;t need to replace the line until I reached the other side. It would have be wise to have kept the rock bag when I threw out the rest of the line (for this amazing shelter also had a trash can) since it is much easier to find paracord by itself.</p>
  <p>It was only about half a mile from the shelter to Fontana Dam itself. The dam was full of construction vehicles and workers and was closed to drivers, but no one paid me any attention as I crossed on foot. Just up the road I officially entered the Smokies and placed the torn off section of my pass into the over stuffed collection box. From there it was a grueling constant climb to get up onto the ridge of the park. About halfway (in terms of distance, more in terms of elevation) I took the side trail to Shuckstack Fire Tower which had amazing views that were unfortunately slightly degraded by the tinted windows you had to look through to see it.</p>
  
  <p>At the top of the ridge the trail turned and joined with the Tennessee border. From here the trail crosses the border a lot, sometimes staying close, sometimes deviating further to either side, but for some reason this all seems to still be considered the &quot;North Carolina&quot; section. Right as you approach Tennessee for the first time the forest floor is covered in tiny white flowers as far as the eye can see. It was a nice spot to stop for lunch.</p>
  
  <p>I continued on to the first shelter, Mollies Ridge Shelter, to end the short but difficult day. In hindsight going the extra distance to the next shelter would have made it much easier to have consistent mileages through the rest of the Smokies just based on where the shelters are located. We had been hearing conflicting information about whether the COVID polices to allow social distancing by camping at the shelters was still in place. My understanding was that the previous system said that thru-hikers had to stay inside the shelters in the Smokies (to prevent overuse of the environment), but if section hikers showed up, no matter how late, they could kick thru-hikers out of a full shelter due to having reserved and paid for shelter spaces, at which point the thru-hiker would have to set up a tent. Whether or not the COVID policies had been official rescinded, a sign describing them was still posted on the shelter, which many hikers took advantage of. I had my first dinner from my pieced together resupply by making a whole packet of instant mashed potatoes. This turned out to be incredibly hard to get down in one sitting! (After the Smokies I only ever had a bit of mashed potatoes at a time, using it by adding it to the meal to soak up any potential extra water I may have still had after cooking).</p>
  
  <p>This was the first shelter that didn&apos;t have a privy (a hallmark of Tennessee). I can not overstate how non-ideal this was, especially for a high use spot in a well trafficked National Park. There was a designated &quot;toilet area&quot; on one side of the ridge. After taking a couple steps down the worn paths there was just toilet paper everywhere blowing about in the wind. At least a couple very noticeable piles of unburied waste. My suspicion is that less experienced hikers traversing the Smokies may not come prepared to dig a cat hole, as the situation was nowhere near as bad at the shelters without privies outside the Smokies.</p>

  <p>Not every shelter in the Smokies was without a privy. The next shelter a couple miles down the trail had one. It was a brand new fancy privy, which might indicate that they are (hopefully) being added to the shelters that didn&apos;t already have one. All the new privies along the trail are very spacious (complete with grab bars and ramps) to comply with ADA standards, a sharp contrast to the rugged terrain they are located within.</p>
  <p>The highlight of the hike was the two summits of Rocky Top and Thunderhead Mountain. Rocky Top had a long climb to a, believe it or not, rocky top with one prominent large boulder good for posing for summit photos. The vegetation was low enough to allow views in all directions. The hike to Thunderhead Mountain was extremely quick since there was not much change in elevation, but the views were much more obscured.</p>
  <p>In general, the Smokies was not the hardest hiking. You&apos;re going up and down a lot, but the only massive climb is to get up on the ridge at the very start. Nevertheless it was a hard day for me, and I was more irritable while hiking and at camp. It became clear that while I had enough food in terms of meals, the calorie count for those meals was much too low. I didn&apos;t look too closely as I was making substitutions to my normal resupply to work with what was available. For example a Knorr Side turns out to only have about 60% as many calories as a box of Macaroni and Cheese. I would say that this was just about when my &quot;hiker hunger&quot; hit as well, making the rest of the Smokies pretty stressful. My mood was not helped by Derrick Knob Shelter also not having a privy.</p>

  <p>Today had a motivating goal of Clingmans Dome followed quickly by the 200 mile mark. The hiking was objectively harder than it was yesterday, but my mood was a lot better. Right as you pass one of the shelters (I think it was Double Spring Gap Shelter) the trail enters a beautiful coniferous forest that is a stunning change of scenery. It had a magical fairy tale look to it, with all types of mosses blanketing the fallen logs strewn about the forest floor, which pictures simply could not capture. The forest looked ancient and, for the first time, like it had been allowed to exist in a natural state without much human management. It continued like this up and over Clingmans Dome.</p>
  <p>The Appalachian Trail skirts right past the summit of Clingmans Dome with just a couple foot long side trail to join up with the paved path from the parking to the tower. Joining that path was like entering an alternate reality. It was completely packed with visitors who were just out for the day. When I climbed the tower I was met with an unusually clear day with views far into the distance. A lot of the thru-hikers all ended up congregating afterwards at the base. Clingmans Dome is the highest point on the Appalachian Trail, and it felt like even more of a milestone than the GA/NC border.</p>
  
  <p>I had previously visited Clingmans Dome back in 2021 (on a day with no views) since it is a state high point, and the section between there and Newfound Gap was the first part of the trail that I had already hiked. That trip didn&apos;t go as well as it could have. I was not in quite as good of backpacking shape as I had thought after a year and a half spent mostly indoors thanks to the pandemic. I pushed myself too hard after taking too long to drive up to the parking lot, and had to set up a stealth camp far before my intended target of Mount Collins Shelter after throwing up behind a log (the first thing I ever used the trowel I carried while backpacking to actually bury!). I can&apos;t lie and claim that I wasn&apos;t apprehensive about climbing Clingmans Dome again. I finally spent the night at Mount Collins Shelter this time and the whole way there I was trying to spot the location I camped last time, but I did&apos;t see it.</p>

  <p>Mount Collins Shelter was down a decently long side trail with the water source even further. The shelters had been mostly empty at night in the Smokies (with most pitching tents), but it was forecasted to rain tonight so the shelter was completely full. Throughout the trail I spent time around groups of hikers traveling together and solo hikers, both of whose company I enjoyed, but only when I was around the groups were shelter spots competitive. The Smokies just happened to be a place where I was traveling at the same pace as two different groups of hikers, so I was ecstatic to get one of the spots tonight.</p>

  <p>I had  a hard time getting motivated to get started on a cold rainy day. Most hikers left camp really early to get to Newfound Gap for the shuttle into town. I knew from my previous trip just how long that road to Gatlinburg could take, and the shuttle hours were such that it would be hard to have enough time to do anything useful and still catch the shuttle back to the trail, and Gatlinburg would be wildly expensive if I had to end up spending the night while simultaneously having nothing I was interested in seeing. I therefore didn&apos;t care about making the shuttle. There was also some stubbornness to make the amount of food I had planned for the Smokies actually work without an unplanned resupply.</p>

  <p>I got caught in a bit of heavy rain before I made it to the parking area at Newfound Gap. The section had some metal grating to maneuver over that provided a barrier against wild boars, normally not a challenge, but very slippery in the rain! The sign in the parking lot was the first indication I saw on the trail itself that we had joined up with the Tennessee border. I hadn&apos;t seen almost any day hikers along this section from the shelter, and was surprised to see so many heading north along the trail, a section that I didn&apos;t think held any particularly interesting landmarks for a day hiker, especially compared to heading south. There was only drizzle to Icewater Spring Shelter, and I decided to stay there to dodge the rest of the heavy rain later in the day. I arrived early in the day though, so the rest of the afternoon I got to see hikers stop in and then carry on. I&apos;m pleased looking back at my decisions to stay as happy, warm and dry as possible in the first half of the trail, but it does feel like slacking in the moment.</p>

    <p>Today the Smoky Mountains were actually smoky! I&apos;m so glad that I had good views from Clingmans Dome on this hike, but at the same time it would have been a bummer to miss out on what gives the Smoky Mountains their name. I didn&apos;t know what Charlies Bunion was, and when I saw the sign for it I figured it wouldn&apos;t be worth the side trip if there was no views today. After learning more about it later, it probably would have still been a lot of fun anyway and I wish I had done it. I felt pretty good hiking until about lunch time. It was a cold day that sapped my energy though, and by the time I arrived at Tri-Corner Knob Shelter (12 miles in and my plan for the day) I was really dragging and felt terrible.</p>
    
    <p>Sitting there and recovering it was pretty clear that it was going to be really close in terms of having enough food to get out of the Smokies. A lot of the hikers who were already there were discussing pushing on the extra eight miles to Cosby Knob Shelter as it was substantially downhill. I got to thinking myself, and if I could pull it off I would get out of the Smokies a day early and I would easily have more than enough food to eat plentifully. After eating the snack that I had allocated either way, I was feeling better and I decided to go for it. I started by eating basically every piece of (the now) extra food, rationing just a bit of the surplus for every half hour of hiking for the rest of the day. The eight miles went quickly and I actually felt great arriving at the shelter. A number of other hikers who were still on the fence about the idea when I left showed up as well. Everyone was able to get a shelter spot, which was fortunate as there were not many good flat options here for a tent. For many of us, including myself, this was the first 20 mile day of the hike and represented a change in mindset about how much would be possible in a single day.</p>

  <section id="at_day_24"><h2>16 April 2023 &mdash; Day 24</h2>
  <p>Before I even started hiking, I had noted the presence of a <a href="https://coord.info/GC7B69D" class="external_link">virtual Geocache</a> on the top of Mount Cammerer, which looked like a long but potentially worthwhile side trip. With a distance of 0.6 miles off trail each way, in the difficult Smokies, I didn&apos;t think that I was really going to end up doing it by the time I got there. Now that the decision was upon me, I found myself facing an easier than expected day with just over 10 miles of mostly descent. I was also trying to out walk a potential approaching storm (as I looked at the weather forecast for various landmarks ahead of me, the storm was scheduled to arrive later and later the further it was along the trail, allowing for the possibility to always stay in front of it assuming I kept a good pace), and was eager to resupply. Given the full circumstances, I think I would have skipped it most cases, but the view along the short section of trail before the junction convinced me otherwise. Part of it was along a ridge, which would have provided a good view if not for some high growing plants. Through them, I was just able to catch glimpses of mountain tops peaking out of the low lying clouds. My hiking is not largely motivated by the views themselves, but this is the one type of view I am a real sucker for.</p>
  
  <p>The side trip was absolutely worth it. The trail just by itself was a gorgeous narrow path through vegetation and lichen. The summit had an interesting octagonal lookout which was picturesque from a distance, although slightly worn down up close. The view was completely unobstructed and the clouds were still below the distant mountain tops.</p>
  
  <p>I stopped for lunch at Davenport Shelter. The open side of the shelter had a metal cage across it. This used to be a common feature of the shelters in the Smokies (if I&apos;ve heard correctly) to protect against animals at night, but I believe this is the only shelter that still has it. The rumor is that hikers who felt protected by the cages would intentionally lure bears to come closer as some sort of reverse zoo! Thus they had to be removed.</p>
  
  <p>Right after leaving the Smokies, the trail traverses a small strip of land squeezed between TN-32/NC-1397 and Interstate 40, complete with a power line cut down the middle. If ever there was an uninteresting piece of trail that existed just for the sake of continuity, I would have expected this to be it. I was surprised with a beautiful section of peaceful streams and waterfalls. There was a nice trail magic set up before the bridge across Pigeon River (to avoid rules regarding hosting such things in the National Park itself I believe) by a hiker that had just finished in 2022. You run across a lot of people (especially around the trail) who treat a thru-hike as a super impressive, near impossible feat. It is a nice sentiment, but can increase how daunting the whole thing feels at such an early stage! It is always great to have the reminders that it is also something that is achievable.</p>
  
  <p>After crossing under the interstate, it was a short walk to the infamous Standing Bear Farm. It lived up to its reputation as one of the wilder places on trail. One of the &quot;hikers&quot; there had been staying at the farm for a month already. Drug use (at least that I saw) was not as common on the trail as I&apos;d been led to believe it would be, but this place was quite the exception, both in terms of quantity and variety. While taking care of town chores, I got to be a bystander to a full hour long lecture on all the supposed wondrous benefits of kratom. The hikers I met later, who stayed here just four days after I did, had surreal tales of that celebration. I had been warned to check the resupply for expired food, but I did not find that to be much of a problem. The only slightly expired food item I found was bacon cheese flavored pretzels. I bought them anyway and they were the tastiest food I packed out with me on the entire hike. I did have a fun time playing cards (including learning some new games) late into the night. Overall, it was something of a rite of passage as a thru-hiker to have stayed here, but I would not do it again.</p>

  <p>This was the first day with over a mile of ascent. Approximately half of that came in one push at the very start of the day to get on top of Snowbird Mountain. The trail passed through some thin reedy plants, that looked possibly burnt, before breaking out into a bald patch. On top of the mountain was a VOR tower (used in aircraft navigation) which was a peculiar shape. From a distance you could see it was covered in warning signs, but this of course just increased the intrigue and would almost guarantee you had to walk close enough to be able to read them. The signs were basically just trying to convey that messing with the equipment could imperil the safe operation of aircraft, so please don&apos;t do that.</p>
  
  <p>From here there were a more broken up series of climbs up to the much anticipated Max Patch Mountain. This was another bald mountain, with just grass covering the top, which made for unobstructed views. It was not a peaceful place when I went over it between brutally heavy wind and a lot of noise from both day hikers and a large group of thru-hikers. The wind alone drove me to get up and over it, and back into tree cover, as quickly as I could. I didn&apos;t go much further, ending the day at Roaring Fork Shelter. A cold night had me in my tent as soon as I was finished cooking dinner.</p>

  <p>It was still cold in the morning, and throughout the day there were periods where the temperature was right on that line where it is too warm with the fleece layer on, and too cold without it. The climbs at the start of the day seemed pretty unremarkable. There was some trail magic at Garenflo Gap, basically just a guy handing out soda from his truck. I had found myself just naturally drinking soda at increasingly infrequent intervals in life, and the last time I had had one was a couple of years ago, and I was only able to make it through about a third of the can that time. I was stunned to find that I was able to drink the whole thing so quickly now. Afterwards I felt queasy for a couple hours, but the soda was sure an effective way of delivering energy and I zoomed my way up the remaining climbs.</p>
  
  <p>Overall though, it was a day of decent. It was the first day with over a mile of descent, mirroring yesterday&apos;s ascent statistics. I remember the section into Hot Springs as one of the worst, knee-killing, descents of the whole trail. It didn&apos;t help that the early glimpses of the town gave a false impression of how close it really was. I was glad I had chosen the hostel at the very edge of town to set the pack down as soon as possible to begin a bit of recovery.</p>
  
  <p>Later I headed into town for dinner. I was taking a zero day in Hot Springs, so I didn&apos;t need to worry about seeing the sites just now. There were a number of options for resupply, so I took a quick look in each of the stores just to see what they had and mentally work on planning my resupply strategy. The pizza place very generously (and unnecessarily) gave me an extra replacement pizza when the first one got misshapen, which didn&apos;t last long when I took it to the trivia night to share. My trivia team got fourth place. My only real contribution to this effort was identifying the Bay of Bengal as the largest bay in the world. My share of the prize was, nevertheless, delicious!</p>

  <section id="at_day_27"><h2>19 April 2023 &mdash; Day 27</h2>
  <p>I started my zero day checking the various hiker boxes at all the relevant establishments in town. I found two of the good durable tent stakes (the ones that came with the Durston tent were incredibly mangled at this point) and, for some reason, a nice ball of yarn. Always a surprise what will be in those boxes. Another hiker gave me their paracord bear hang line, that they were planning to get rid of anyway, to replace the one that broke at Fontana Dam. It lasted me the rest of the hike (although it was quite gross at that point after being out in so much rain).</p>
  
  <p>I completed my food resupply by grabbing some pieces from pretty much every store that sold food in town, returning back and forth to the hostel between each stop to drop off what I had just purchased. After my experience in the Smokies, I definitely overdid it when buying food. I was starting to dread having to carry it out of town the next day (for you almost always have to climb your way out of town) as I was working to consolidate and package it all up.</p>
  
  <p>One day was just about the right amount of time to see all the sights in town. I had plans to experience the hot springs themselves, but this fell through due to concerns about rumors of potential norovirus spread at the hostel. (I did notice a lot of norovirus going around a bit later, but not that I could personally tie to any one establishment). This was secretly a bit of a relief. It was the sort of new experience I felt I should be seeking out on this adventure, but not something that I actually cared all that much about doing.</p>

  <section id="at_day_28"><h2>20 April 2023 &mdash; Day 28</h2>
  <p>I woke up this morning with a bit of a sore throat. I figured this was probably just due to walking around town yesterday in the heat and lack of shade. While hiking, I&apos;m always carrying water, and the hose setup makes it available to me at any moment. I wasn&apos;t carrying around a bottle of water yesterday (while my packed stayed at the hostel) and therefore probably wasn&apos;t drinking anywhere near enough.</p>
  
  <p>It was a hot day again with less than the usual amount of shade on trail. I really struggled climbing out of town with the fully loaded pack, and was taking much more frequent breaks. Even after the trail leveled out I was continuing to feel worse and worse as the day progressed. I took a long break when the trail joined up with Mill Ridge Road, but despite that I was completely exhausted by the time I reached Tanyard Gap just under a mile further up the trail. While trying to recover there it seemed like I had three options. I could carry on, but I was right at the base of another steep climb, and the next guaranteed camping spot was two and a half miles away. I could try to ride it out by camping where I was, but there was no water source available there if I ran out. Or I could spend the money for a shuttle back to Hot Springs.</p>
  
  <p>During outdoor adventures, it is extremely important to make good decisions when things start to go wrong. I decided to head back to Hot Springs. This was absolutely the right call as I continued to feel even worse in the evening despite no longer hiking. I set up my tent in the yard at the hostel to isolate myself as best I could and got some rest.</p>

  <section id="at_day_29"><h2>21 April 2023 &mdash; Day 29</h2>
  <p>I felt way worse today, and continued to get new symptoms throughout. The most prominent was a massive headache. I felt like I had to cough at times, but I literally couldn&apos;t as coughing made my head hurt too much. It was bad enough that I couldn&apos;t read, and I couldn&apos;t even really watch videos on my phone. I got the audio version of one of my favorite books through the library app and just lied there listening to that for most of the day. It was way too hot during the day in my tent, and even being directly in the sun was too hot. Being in the shade was too cool, so I had to straddle the ever moving boundary between the sun and the shade cast by a large tree to stay comfortable. I tried my best to isolate myself, but it was not easy. Since Hot Springs is such a popular place to take a zero there were almost always hikers hanging out in the section of the hostel I had to pass through to use the restroom or get water. I developed a bit of nausea later in the day and didn&apos;t eat all that much. It was a pretty stressful situation worrying about losing time and not knowing how long it would be before I was able to get back to hiking, or what the best course of action would be to make sure I was fully recovered first when I did start feeling better.</p>

I read almost all the way through the fantastic <i>Dragon&apos;s Egg</i> by Robert Forward, which had been on my &quot;to read&quot; list for a long time, and was able to catch up on watching some competitive climbing on the Wi-Fi. My appetite returned and my morale was just so much better than it had been yesterday.</p>

  <section id="at_day_31"><h2>23 April 2023 &mdash; Day 31</h2>
  <p>I had a dream where I was still working on packing up my personal belongings to get them into storage in preparation for the trail. My dream self found this very confusing and unsettling since I still had this unshakable sense that I had at least started hiking and had done enough to finish Georgia. I was not able to figure out why, then, I would have needed to go back and do more to get ready!</p>
  
  <p>I felt like I was ready to try doing some more hiking, but decided to wait until the middle of the day and to only do a couple of miles to the first shelter from where I left off. This ended up being convenient as the shuttle drivers were busy in the morning setting up slackpacking (where some hikers choose to hike sections of the trail without their full pack) anyway. I was still trying to isolate to the greatest extent manageable, so while I could have gotten a spot on one of those shuttles, I preferred to spend the additional money to have my own.</p>
  
  <p>To make my life a little easier, I had reassessed how much food I was going to bring. I had seen some hikers pack out frosting to eat with cookies for the extra calories, so I had gotten a can to try for myself. After being sick though, I just couldn&apos;t bring myself to actually eat that, so that was one of the things I left behind!</p>
  
  <p>It was a cold day of hiking. The miles didn&apos;t come easy, but I just took it really slow on all the hills. Took the side trip up the fire tower on Rich Mountain. The views were great, but I didn&apos;t stay long due to the wind. I got to camp around the same time I normally would due to starting so late. In the first place I tried to set up my tent, I was warned by a hiker whose tent was already set up nearby that they had norovirus and that I might want to choose another location. Seeing first hand how miserable it looked to be sick for days at a shelter, I was extremely glad I decided to head back to Hot Springs when I did. The temperature was forecasted to drop below freezing at night, which meant the water filter and electronics needed to be protected by being placed in the sleeping bag with me.</p>

  <section id="at_day_32"><h2>24 April 2023 &mdash; Day 32</h2>
  <p>I woke up very early in the morning to find condensation covering the entire outside of my sleeping bag and sweat covering the entire inside. This was a pretty alarming development with a down sleeping bag and the cold weather. I used the free buff to wipe both off as best I could, went back to sleep, and luckily suffered no ill consequences from it the rest of the night.</p>
  
  <p>It remained a cold day and I hiked so slowly that by the time I got to the next shelter there really wasn&apos;t enough time left in the day to carry on. I was pretty spaced out as well and completely missed all the Geocaches I had planned for the day. This was yet another low mileage day (8.6 miles) and I was starting to get really (unnecessarily) nervous about my pace. I spent some time at the shelter constructing a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11fQgVTc-4Vv--is1egG1MFIR57CliMFMqGJyRWJPY8U" class="external_link">spreadsheet</a> to track my progress and make a number of crude projections at different average paces. It was a little bit reassuring to see that, even after all the time I lost, I was still on track to finish in November. This would be too late, but was at least close enough to when I would need to be finished that I had no worries about being able to get to the pace I needed. This was the first night I cooked what came to be my standard dinner for the rest of the trail: a Knorr side plus a ramen plus a tuna (or other meat) packet all mixed together.</p>

  <section id="at_day_33"><h2>25 April 2023 &mdash; Day 33</h2>
  <p>It was so great to have a really nice day on trail again. The weather felt much warmer despite the forecast being the same. The terrain was also really interesting. I wasted a descent amount of time doing some sketchy down climbing around Blackstaff Cliffs looking in vain for a Geocache. From there, the trail followed the top of a ridge over Big Firescald Knob. All of the vegetation was low lying and there were many spectacular views along the length. Right before the end of the ridge section I got to celebrate crossing the 300 mile mark. Later, I took the short side trail to the top of Big Butt Peak. Someone in the government must not have liked that name since the benchmark at the top instead read &quot;Big Rock&quot;!</p>
  
  <p>It was a tight fit getting my tent set up at the shelter, but I was resolved to continue isolating for at least one more day. I had hiked a respectable 14 miles today to make it to Flint Mountain Shelter. It was a big relief to see that my daily rate (the most volatile, but also most responsive, of the indicators) would have me finishing in September. Seeing this basically stopped all my worries about finishing in time for the rest of the trail, so the spreadsheet did its job!</p>

  <section id="at_day_34"><h2>26 April 2023 &mdash; Day 34</h2>
  <p>A monstrously difficult day. Hogback Ridge Shelter was only 9 miles in, which wasn&apos;t nearly enough, but it would be another 10 miles after that to reach the next shelter. There were also far more Geocaches than normal, and for some reason I got it in my head that I had to at least briefly look for every one of them today. Quite a few I was unable to find in the time I allotted myself for each, but there were plenty I did get checked off.</p>
  
  <p>Just about when I crossed Interstate 26 it started to rain. The forecast had only a 20% chance for a tenth of an inch of rain, which I would have to say was a pretty dramatic underestimate. It let up at one point, but then only came back harder as I trudged along. Given how massive the complex at Wolf Laurel Resort looked on the map, I was surprised that I could see no trace of it from the trail, being just on the other side of a ridge. A guy appeared out of nowhere from that direction and generously offered to take my trash off of my hands, but there was no way I was going to dig it out of my pack in the rain. I took a wrong turn before the summit of Big Bald where the AT splits off on an easy to miss narrow trail while the wide trail we had been walking on continues up a different route. Already a tough enough day without having to backtrack! The rain was so much worse on the bald without the tree cover. The ground had completely turned to mud and I was slipping around all over the place. The was one short incline I could barely get up without continuously sliding back down.</p>
  
  
  <p>I finally arrived at Bald Mountain Shelter much later than normal, soaking wet, and looking forward to getting out of the rain only to find the shelter itself was already full. Whoever designed the shelter put in thin raised slats between all the &quot;spots&quot;, so even if the other hikers had been willing to try to squeeze, it simply couldn&apos;t have been done with such a configuration. There is no way else it could work in practice, but it is a cruel irony that whoever had the hardest day (and therefore arrived last) was the least likely to get their preferred spot at night. It was something I was on the other side of plenty myself. At least everyone else being in the shelter meant that there were great tent spots available, and I threw mine up as fast as I could after leaving the rest of the pack under the shelter overhang for the time being. I cooked dinner under the cover of the shelter as well and it was the coldest I had been so far. Shivered the entire time I was cooking and eating. It was so cold that my olive oil had solidified and I was not able to add it to my dinner! And thus I ended the day in a poor mood.</p>

  <section id="at_day_35"><h2>27 April 2023 &mdash; Day 35</h2>
  <p>A straightforward, typical day. I got a late start as I was procrastinating packing up the wet tent. The forecast had more rain for today (and in fact for the next couple of days), but it held off until the afternoon. At No Business Knob Shelter I had to decide if I was going to stay there for the night or hike further into Erwin. If I could have gotten in touch with the hostel on the phone this would have been an easy decision since I would have gone if and only if they had space available. Unfortunately I didn&apos;t have any cell signal at the shelter, so it was a bit of a gamble when I headed out. Since I was now going into town either way, I no longer needed breakfast food and I was able to give away the gross berry flavored bagels from an unfamiliar brand that were cranberry instead of the blueberry I had been expecting. After Hot Springs, I was dreading the descent into Erwin, but this one was easy on the knees, probably thanks to the extreme number of switchbacks they managed to design into that section of the trail. I developed the first real hiking blister of my life on my right foot, and I believe trying to step in weird ways to avoid it was the cause of some other minor foot pains I experienced.</p>
  
  <p>I was able to get in touch with the hostel not too long after leaving the shelter and reserve my bunk. I felt a little guilty about it in terms of pace, but after the debacle that was Hot Springs I decided that I wanted to take an actually relaxing zero day in Erwin. I guess it is possible the two additional days of rain still in the forecast might have factored into that decision as well... With that settled, I didn&apos;t need to worry about resupplying this evening, and I was the only one at the hostel that decided to go to the local diner for dinner. Thankfully the hostel shuttle was willing to make a special drop off for me as it drove past. The diner had way too many options to have to choose from!</p>

  <section id="at_day_36"><h2>28 April 2023 &mdash; Day 36</h2>
  <p>I felt even more guilty taking the zero when it didn&apos;t really rain all that much at the hostel after all (although, again, this doesn&apos;t mean it was the same on trail). However, I did get so much taken care of since there wasn&apos;t much to explore on foot from the hostel this time. A full day was plenty of time to deal with &quot;town chores&quot;, but is becoming very clear that I cannot take a full day every time I go into town, and that I&apos;m not practiced at getting it all done efficiently and quickly. I had access to a full grocery store with ample resupply options by taking the mid-day shuttle into town. I was able to shave for the first time on trail, which was a relief since I was still not used to the scratchy feeling of longer facial hair. But most importantly, I had the refreshing rest that I didn&apos;t end up getting in Hot Springs. I spent most of the day socializing with everyone else taking a zero. I had neither skill nor luck trying to play Scrabble. After many turns in a row failing to draw a needed A or R, my only hope of getting QUARTZ down on the board, and getting rid of those terrible letters, was dashed after the only suitable (and also high scoring) spot was taken immediately after I finally did get the needed tile!</p>

  <section id="at_day_37"><h2>29 April 2023 &mdash; Day 37</h2>
  <p>I finally felt completely back to normal after getting sick. This was a great day of hiking. The forecasted rain didn&apos;t come until after I was already set up in camp. The sun broke through the canopy all day, and the woods were alive with the songs of a wide variety of birds. There was almost a mile of elevation gain, but it passed by mostly without notice as the grade was mild. There were more open balds, but the wind was calm making it vastly more enjoyable to be on top of them. There was unexpected trail magic at the top of one of the balds with a massive setup including cooked hot dogs and fresh fruit under a large canopy tent. It made sense as a location once you got there and could see the parking area nearby, but it really looked while climbing up to it that everything must have been dragged up there by hand. Finished the full day of hiking at Cherry Gap Shelter. It was a difficult place to get a food bag hung, something I hadn&apos;t needed to do since before the Smokies due to provided food storage methods at the shelters.</p>

  <section id="at_day_38"><h2>30 April 2023 &mdash; Day 38</h2>
  <p>The weather was far worse today. The rain started just minutes before I would have started packing up camp, and was coming down hard from the get go. Luckily the shelter provided a covered place to stage all my other gear as I dismantled the protection of the tent. As would be common on rainy days, I trudged along getting my ten miles in to another shelter and promptly called it quits for the day. I kept my head down, and the miles passed without much notice over pretty typical terrain. I immediately got my sleeping bag set up in Clyde Smith Shelter despite it still being mid-day since the rain also brought the cold. Funny enough, the rain actually stopped shortly after I arrived (although the cold did not), which meant that my hiking for the day ended up exactly correlating to the only times it was raining! A lot of people showed up to the shelter for a break, and chance to dry their tent, before moving on. I definitely considered moving on too since the rain had stopped, but the forecast showed the night being incredibly cold and the next shelter (Roan High Knob) was the one with the highest elevation of the entire trail, and had an even worse forecast include snow! Hearing from people later on who did stay up there tonight makes me convinced it was a good decision to stay put after all.</p>
  
  <p>A hiker doing a short section of the AT showed up at the shelter later in the evening with the largest handgun you could imagine strapped directly across the front of his chest. All the thru-hikers found this highly amusing simply from a weight perspective, as we&apos;ve been trying to find ways to shed as much weight from our packs as possible.</p>

  <section id="at_day_39"><h2>1 May 2023 &mdash; Day 39</h2>
  <p>It was hard to believe just how cold it was, especially now that I had made it to May. This was the coldest single day on trail. The forecasted snow was there, albeit just as a very patchy dusting coating the ground. Even more interesting were the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needle_ice" class="external_link">ice needle</a> formations, which looked extremely unnatural pushing out in wisps from the mud. The start of the day was a long climb to Roan High Knob, and I had to wear basically every piece of clothing I had to keep warm. I had to use the free buff from Franklin to cover my face as a balaclava, and would have had a really miserable time without it. As it was, I had to perform many readjustments as the moisture condensation from breathing would collect on it and then sort of freeze in place. Roan High Knob itself was a nice pine forest, but didn&apos;t have any real views or other features of particular note. I would have visited the unusual shelter at the top if the weather had been nicer, but I had to keep moving in the cold. I had been led to believe there were also restrooms available at the top (which would have been great since Clyde Smith Shelter did not have a privy). I found most of them locked, and the two that were open had non-functioning flush toilets that were already filled past the brim of the seat.</p>
  
  <p>I took a wrong turn on the way down when I missed a switchback and found myself on Forest Service Road 1348 unexpectedly. It was a very quick trip back up the side trail to fix the mistake and make it to the correct trail head in Carver&apos;s Gap. Up Round Bald and beyond to the other balds the terrain dramatically changed to have expansive views in all directions. Included in that was the ability to see far ahead to the slopes that were yet to be climbed, which always look more intimidating than they end up being. Despite being less celebrated, it was definitely the more scenic of the two directions out of the gap. It did warm up a bit throughout the day, but that was offset by the increased exposure to the wind, so it didn&apos;t really feel warmer until the trail curved around Grassy Ridge Bald.</p>
  
  <p>I was planning to stop for the day at Stan Murray Shelter, but after taking a bit of time to study the map further, I noticed the Overmountain Shelter option I had previously overlooked which was just a couple miles further. The shelter itself was closed due to structural issues that made it unsafe to occupy. However the site still had a privy (an odd one with the most minimal of walls and an open side directly facing a far away house on the hill side) and was known for having an incredible view. The location was a bit out of the way down a side trail, but the maps showed backup camping locations on the trail near that junction as well. No backup would ever be needed I reckon; the location was a large flat field with the most space for tents I&apos;d seen at any shelter. The view was down a valley and we could watch the birds circle overhead. My fuel can ran out only a couple minutes into cooking Macaroni and Cheese and I ended up with the saddest meal of very soupy barely cooked noodles.</p>

  <p>The same features that gave the campsite its amazing view also meant there was no protection from the wind. My tent took a beating all night long, flapping about in the strong winds. I had been acquiring abandoned tent stakes as I found them to replace the poor quality ones that came with the Durston tent. I used every stake I had with me to reinforce the tent, but I could have used even more to shore up the middle of all of the sides. The wind was so loud that I had to use earplugs despite being in my tent, and I still didn&apos;t sleep all that well.</p>
  
  <p>The wind continued to be ferocious as I started the climbs up Little Hump Mountain and Hump Mountain. These were also bald mountains with no trees to break up the wind. It was so strong that I was routinely being blown a foot or two off the path with each step, basically trying to walk at a steep angle just for the end result to be walking in a straight line. The wind was so strong that it was legitimately hard to breathe; the air being pushed away from my mouth too fast unless I was facing in the exact opposite direction. I had only experienced these conditions one before in the Mourne Mountains of Northern Ireland. There were large boulders off to the side of the trail, and I took brief refuge behind each as I passed.</p>
  
  <p>Upon reaching the other side of Hump Mountain, there was finally some protection from the wind. It was still there, but at normal manageable levels and somewhat intermittent. This was another section where the constant changes made it hard to manage the clothing layers well. There were a couple tricky rocky sections, but I was very quickly at the official end of the &quot;North Carolina&quot; section.</p>
