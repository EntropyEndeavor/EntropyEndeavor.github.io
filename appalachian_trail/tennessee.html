  <section id="at_day_40"><h2>2 May 2023 &mdash; Day 40</h2>
  <p>When I reached US 19-E I did the sketchy walk along the shoulder of the road to make it to Mountain Harbour B&amp;B to try to replace my fuel can that had just run out the night before. I made it there only to find that their last fuel can had been sold just a couple minutes prior! I didn&apos;t need to make it that much further to have another chance to buy one, but there were no partially empty ones to grab from the hiker boxes as is usually the case. Luckily for me, the owner went above and beyond to get me set up with a personal one they hadn&apos;t used in a while. It was a good place to eat lunch and pick up some additional snacks such as ice cream!</p>
  
  <p>The weather finally warmed up a bit as I got started back on the trail. It didn&apos;t last that long until it started to lightly drizzle though. I took the side trail to Jones Falls, which was my favorite blue blaze of the entire trail. It was a very geometric and three dimensional waterfall that the video doesn&apos;t even begin to properly convey. After that, the trail just barely dipped back into North Carolina one last time before following the path of Elk River. My understanding is that this final piece of North Carolina was a relatively new addition to the trail after some recent rerouting. The trail goes right by Mountaineer Falls, where the water runs along a rock slab for a ways before abruptly falling off, before reaching the aptly named Mountaineer Falls Shelter where I spent the night. A number of hikers (both thru and section) hung out at the shelter for dinner, but most went off to tent for the night. I had the entire top of the massive shelter to myself and made the full use out of it!</p>

  <section id="at_day_41"><h2>3 May 2023 &mdash; Day 41</h2>
  <p>The day started out following some fairly typical and unremarkable sections of trail. I made it to Moreland Gap Shelter for lunch, which was the windiest shelter I experienced on trail. We might have just got unlucky to have the wind blowing directly into the open side, but I suspect not since someone had gone to the trouble of rigging up and leaving behind a tarp across the entrance. It didn&apos;t help much.</p>
  
  <p>At Dennis Cove Road the trail got incredibly smooth, flat and wide. I wasn&apos;t well enough versed in the design patterns of the trail at this point to recognize the tell tale signs of a highly trafficked tourist area! As such, I was fully surprised by the stunning section to follow. We started out by passing through a gap between two rock faces textured by bulging blocky formations. The path joined up with, and then crossed over, Laurel Fork. Along the river were vivid pink flowers which were a sharp contrast to all the typical greens, browns and grays. A side trail continued at the same elevation providing a designated high water route. I think this may have been the first one, and I was struggling to understand how it would be necessary. It could be a tempting option for those who don&apos;t care about following the exact route of the AT because at the junction the AT turns down an unending path of stone steps. I had some soreness in my ankles, and the steps slowed me to a crawl as I took it easy and slow. At the bottom, I was rewarded with a massive waterfall as the trail rejoined Laurel Fork. After taking it in for a bit, it was not immediately obvious where the trail continued. There seemed to be no place to go as the river ran along the base of a sheer rock wall. Eventual I realized there was a narrow ledge, barely narrow enough to walk along, towards the bottom of the wall. The high water route makes perfect sense now!</p>
  
  <p>When I first got it in my head to do a thru hike many years ago, I took in a lot of information about the trail from past thru hikers recollections. However, I had intentionally not been looking up more details for a number of years so that there would still be plenty of surprises along the way. Even so, the AT traverses many iconic locations along the East Coast, and I found out about many of them anyway as I took other hiking trips. This was one of two locations that stuck out to me as extraordinary places I had absolutely no idea existed and caught me completely off guard!</p>
  
  <p>Laurel Fork Shelter was just a slight backtrack along the high water route after it met back up with the AT. It was along a (albeit plenty wide) rocky ledge on the side of a hill, which had a number of disadvantages. There was (of course) no privy as it is Tennessee, and there was basically no place to go to get out of sight of the trail to dig a hole. It was also incredibly hard to find a place to hang a bear bag and it would not have been easy to set up a tent nearby. Only a few hikers showed up for the night. One of them built a fire to cook their food and started cutting up an onion. As they approached the halfway point in the onion I already couldn&apos;t believe they were going to eat so much of it at once, but they kept going. That was their dinner, a whole onion and nothing else! I had a nice night in camp playing Rummy and this was the first night I heard whip-poor-wills, an enjoyable experience when they are far in the distance like they were today!</p>

  <section id="at_day_42"><h2>4 May 2023 &mdash; Day 42</h2>
  <p>The day began with a climb of almost 2,000 feet immediately followed by a descent all the way back to the elevation we started at. It was the perfect example of a trend I had noticed where the AT will go 95% of the way up a mountain, but then fail to actually summit. Even if there were side trails it wouldn&apos;t be quite as annoying. While hiking the AT I would have taken such a side trail. While not hiking the AT I would have bushwhacked. But it would have been too much extra energy expended to do the bushwhack while thru hiking.</p>
  
  <p>At the bottom, I stopped by Boots Off to finally get a full replacement fuel can. I spent a couple hours there using their (empty during the day) lounge area to make phone calls to try to sort out some bureaucratic hassles from normal life that had invaded my trail life. I did a very basic resupply just to top off what I had, and also packed out some Girl Scout cookies. They held up pretty well (for a while at least) and were a popular item to be able to share on the trail.</p>
  
  <p>The section of the trail around Watauga Lake was a local park with lots of (possibly official or unofficial) additional trails. I kept getting confused about what was actually the AT and my frustration was increased by some leg pain despite the easy terrain. I took a long rest looking out over the expansive view from the top of the dam as the vultures circled overhead. After that, the trail started to climb up onto the ridge and was once again easy to follow.</p>
  
  <p>I spent the rest of the day on top of the ridge and I ended the day at Vandeventer Shelter (the shelter that apparently gets stuck by lightning the most, one of the fun AT facts I learned when lightning became a much bigger concern). The entire time along the ridge there were not great opportunities to get water, and there weren&apos;t great opportunities to get water earlier at the lake either. The shelter had the absolute worst side trail to a water source of any shelter: half a mile all the way down to the bottom of the ridge. I was out of breath again just from having to carry the water back up to the top. The comments in FarOut were hilarious. &quot;Build a cabin at the bottom, it would be easier than hiking back out&quot;, and my favorite &quot;The hike back up was so exhausting that I drank all my water on the way up. I had to turn around and go get more water. This has happened five times&quot.</p>

  <section id="at_day_43"><h2>5 May 2023 &mdash; Day 43</h2>
  <p>This was a nice relaxing day with easy terrain, a bit fewer miles and great weather. The rest of the ridge was a little under half of the distance for the day. After that, the trail passed through a number of relatively flat pastures. Part of this section was designed to be handicap accessible and therefore the trail was incredibly smooth. Between both of these main sections being easy, I was able to make it to camp in the middle of the afternoon, which meant I had plenty of time to relax and plan ahead. I figured out a place to get my summer gear shipped and got a list put together of which items I would need.</p>
  
  <p>The forest around Double Spring Shelter was pretty sparse, and didn&apos;t provide for much privacy for digging a cat hole. There was exactly one place that was convenient and hidden, but it had been beyond utilized. The tent sites were not the best either, so I found a spot way down away from the shelter near the stream. Going even further in that direction eventually got me out of sight from the shelter. The running water made for a peaceful campsite, and I listened to the owls until I feel asleep.</p>

  <section id="at_day_44"><h2>6 May 2023 &mdash; Day 44</h2>
  <p>Another relatively straightforward day with a lot to look forward to as I was about to cross my next state line! It started off with a descent to Low Gap where the trail crossed US-421. There was a nice picnic table area, and a piped spring which made it one of the few places the water right next to a road wasn&apos;t sketchy and contaminated.</p>

  </p>Later on in the day, I started to hear really loud engine noises off to the right of the trail where there weren&apos;t any major roads I could see on the map. It wouldn&apos;t have been that odd to have heard it once, but I kept hearing it and it kept getting louder. The trail passed by an extremely early shelter built in 1934 that is no longer officially maintained. It was getting to be about time for lunch, but the next (better furnished) shelter was only a mile and a half away, so I decided to eat there. However, I didn&apos;t make it far before figuring out what the engine noises were all about. I found the trail blocked off by a rally car race. The volunteers stationed there were very insistent that we not try to cross the dirt road, even though you could hear when a car was coming from minutes away. There was one hiker who was very agitated about being held up, and I felt like the volunteers were expecting me to be able to handle it (maybe just because I was first to arrive) and to keep them from crossing anyway. I did what I could to pacify them with Girl Scout cookies and it seemed to work. Truth be told it would have been easy for me to have gotten frustrated with the situation as well since I just wanted to start my break in Damascus, but I made an intentional decision to treat it as an experience. When else am I going to see a rally car race up close! And I still needed a break for lunch anyway.</p>
  
  <p>They let us through after the last car passed by, and it wasn&apos;t long until I reached the Virginia border. I took another quick break at the sign to celebrate the completion of Tennessee!</p>
